#class_name GameHandler

# GameHandler is the global controller for game flow and state.
# It manages high-level game logic like starting, pausing, resuming, and ending the game.
# This script is intended to be an autoload singleton (Project → Project Settings → Globals)
# so it can be accessed globally as `GameHandler`.
